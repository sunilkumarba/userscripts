# Userscripts
Repository of userscripts to used by addons like TamperMonkey, GreaseMonkey etc.

## Onestopstrategy.js

This script enables an user to _*scroll*_ through all of the news articles on **onestopstrategy.com**; instead of having to keep pressing **_Next Page_** button.

An **_Auto Fetch_** button is provided at the bottom right corner to disable scroll-fetching of news articles.

This script also adds CSS styles which helps in cleaning the layout a little bit.

**Future Updates**
 * Support for saving the "Auto Fetch" enabled/disabled status
 * An option to enable/disable custom CSS style. At present it's enabled by default. No way to opt out
